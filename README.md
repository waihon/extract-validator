# Refactoring / Extract Validator

Hey there! We're [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com), a design and
development consultancy that brings your digital product ideas to life.
We also love to share what we learn.

This coding exercise comes from [Upcase](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase),
the online learning platform we run. It's part of the
[Refactoring](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/refactoring) course and is just one small sample of all
the great material available on Upcase, so be sure to visit and check out the rest.

## Exercise Intro

In this exercise, you'll be breaking out a validator for phone numbers in the `Person` class. Currently the validator is a lengthy regular expression (credit: [stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/123559/a-comprehensive-regex-for-phone-number-validation?lq=1)) that matches the [North American Numbering Plan (NANP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Numbering_Plan) standards and includes the ability to use extensions.

Don't let the complexity of the regex intimidate you; it works as any other regex would in a validation and
trying to understand how it works is a great exercise in and of itself.

## Instructions

To start, you'll want to clone and run the setup script for the repo

    git clone git@github.com:thoughtbot-upcase-exercises/extract-validator.git
    cd extract-validator
    bin/setup

Extract a new phone number validator from `Person` (located at `lib/person.rb`). Make sure to write tests for the new validator as you go.

In the end your code should be able to be called in-line as `name_of_validator: true`.

Make sure all tests are passing by running:

    rake
